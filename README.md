# Lucky Person (Счастливчик)
Player is asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions. Each features four possible answers, to which the contestant must give the correct answer. 
Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling more difficult questions increasing their prize fund. 
During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two "safety nets" – 
if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, player will leave with that amount as their prize. 
If a contestant feels unsure about an answer and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won.
